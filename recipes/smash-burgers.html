        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This smash burger recipe makes super juicy burgers with crispy edges. Don't use meat that is leaner 
            than 80/20 for best results, and make sure the meat is very cold. I prefer to cook these outdoors to 
            avoid smoking up the kitchen. These grill up very fast because of the high heat, so make sure you have 
            everything ready to go!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>4 hamburger buns</em></li>
            <li><em>2 tablespoons butter, softened, or as needed</em></li>
            <li><em>1 pound ground chuck beef(80% lean)</em></li>
            <li><em>4 6-inch squares parchment paper</em></li>
            <li><em>salt to taste</em></li>
            <li><em>4 slices American cheese</em></li>
            <li><em>burger toppings of choice</em></li>
        </ul> 
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate. Set a cast iron flat-top griddle or large cast iron skillet onto the grill and preheat until smoking.</li>
            <li>Spread butter on the inside of the buns and toast on the flat-top until lightly browned. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Form meat into 8 loosely-packed balls, 2 ounces each. Do not pack the meat tightly, as this will prevent it from smashing properly. Place each ball on the hot flat-top, cover with a piece of parchment (to prevent sticking to the spatula; re-use each parchment square on a second patty) and immediately smash down to a 1/4 inch thickness using 2 stiff, sturdy spatulas that are criss-crossed to get proper leverage as you press down. You may also use the bottom of small skillet. Sprinkle the meat with salt.</li>
            <li>Grill for about 45 seconds, until the edges are dark brown and the centers are a light pink color. Using a bench scraper or firm spatula, gently scrape up the patties, flip over and immediately cover 4 of them with cheese. Grill an additional 15 to 20 seconds; stack the plain patties over the cheese-covered patties so you have 4 stacks. Move each stack to a bun and serve with your favorite toppings.</li>
        </ol>
